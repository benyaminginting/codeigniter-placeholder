# Placeholder helper for CodeIgniter

This helper allows you to add placeholder images in your applications. It is extremely useful when prototyping the layout of the page.

# Usage

`placeholder(width, height, text, bgcolor, color);`

The helper uses [placehold.it](http://placehold.it) service.

## Examples

- 300px square: `placeholder(300);`.
- 200x100px rectangular: `placeholder(200, 100);`
- 200x100px rectangular with custom text: `placeholder(200, 100, 'Howdy');`
- 100px black square with white text: `placeholder(100, 100, 'Howdy', '000000', 'FFFFFF');`

Note that colors are represented as HEX values (when passing arguments to the function, don't add the pound `#` symbol).

You can also pass in an array:

`placeholder(array('width' => 100, 'height' => 100, 'text' => 'Howdy', 'background' => '000000', 'foreground' => 'FFFFFF'));`
